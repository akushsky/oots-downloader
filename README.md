===============

A simple "The Order Of The Stick" comic downloader written in bash.

I'm a big fan of this webcomic, but I find very annoying to read it from the original website. This script helps me to download the latest comics, both on english or russian, and read them comfortably.

You can find the original comics by Rich Burlew here: http://www.giantitp.com/Comics.html

You can find the translated russian variant here: http://fantasyland.info/comics.php
